# blend.css

Blend.css is a minimal, component based UI library.

It allows you to write and maintain user interfaces with clean, parameterizable code, using adaptable, nestable and ready-to-use components that are configurable in their parameters.

It is not intended to be modified by means of classes, but by well-defined descriptive properties, with the aim of writing code that is readable by developers without prior knowledge.


## Components

Blend.css works around a few key components that can be nested and parameterized separately or together.

All components are configurable using HTML tags that begin with the `bl-` prefix and can be configured using their properties.
